# Glyphr

This will be a Rust no_std library for rasterzing fonts on a framebuffer (or wherever you want to).

I already made a similar project in plain C, but I want to make it better and hopefully faster.

## Features:
- User defined callback to completely abstract the library.
- RLE encoding to keep it lightweight.
- Some others but I'm lazy right now.

## Just a placeholder to keep name mine
